## What is Amidst?

Amidst is a styling library that makes your webapps more accessible and consistent with only 2 lines of code. Amidst will also expose styling tools and classes that you can take advantage of to achieve a more responsive, accessible and consistent look across your app.

**Do you remember to think about the user amidst the thousands of lines of code in your project?**
